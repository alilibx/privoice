# Privoice — Project Status

**Last updated:** 2026-07-11
**Now:** On-device record→transcribe→summarize works; **S5 model download done** (resumable, extraction verified). **Redesign underway** (mockups approved). **R1 done + on-device verified:** elevated calm-teal tokens + **light/dark/system theme setting** (live switch, persisted). **R2 perceived-perf landed:** LLM streaming, result reuse, no double-work, warm-up. **R3 onboarding + staged/background download done + on-device verified (Redmi):** first-launch 3-screen intro, then the app opens while STT+LLM download in the background via `ModelManager`; Record unlocks on STT, AI actions on LLM; `ModelGate` retired. On-device fix: a screen wakelock is held during download (screen-lock was suspending the process and stalling it). Full 1.5 GB download completed on device with the screen awake; staged unlock confirmed. **R4 Home reimagined (code-complete):** library-first grouped list (Today/This week/Earlier) with status dots + a persistent bottom record dock; on-device walkthrough pending. **R5 Record reimagined (code-complete):** calm-teal record screen with a live scrolling waveform driven by mic amplitude; on-device walkthrough pending. **Testing:** T0 ✅ · T1 🔨 (privacy ✅) · T2 ✅ (CI) · T3 ✅ (Test Lab).

**Redesign (R1–R7):** R1 tokens+theme ✅ · R2 perceived-perf ✅ (streaming/reuse/warm-up) · R3 onboarding + staged/background download ✅ *(on-device verified, Redmi)* — 3-screen intro + in-process background download (`ModelManager`) with a **wakelock held during download** (screen-lock was stalling it), per-model feature gating (Record↔STT, AI↔LLM), `ModelGate` retired · R4 home ✅ *(code-complete; on-device pending)* — library-first Home: grouped meeting list (Today/This week/Earlier) with status dots + persistent bottom record dock (waveform + docked mic, R3 gating integrated); FAB + toggle-search retired · R5 record ✅ *(code-complete; on-device pending)* — calm-teal Record screen + live scrolling waveform (mic amplitude via `AudioRecorderHandle.levels()`), injectable recorder for tests · R6 minutes ⬜ · R7 empty/error states + delight ⬜. Next: R6 minutes; **open follow-up — foreground-service downloader** (survive app-background/screen-off/swipe-away, needs a notification + `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`); T4 STT WER harness / T6 perf-thermal (both need on-device runs), golden tests, nightly Test Lab.

## Platforms & new programs (planned)

Privoice is now a **multi-platform suite** from one Flutter codebase + a web/cloud layer.

**Target platforms**
| Platform | Tech | Capability | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Android | Flutter | on-device | ✅ working |
| iOS | Flutter | on-device | ⬜ later |
| macOS / Windows / Linux | Flutter (same codebase) | on-device | ⬜ new (macOS first) |
| Web | Next.js + React | online tier only | ⬜ new |

### Desktop (Flutter, offline) — reuses audio/stt/ai packages
| ID | Item | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| D0 | Enable desktop platforms + verify sherpa/fllama/record build on macOS | ⬜ | macOS first (buildable here) |
| D1 | Platform adaptation: `sqflite_common_ffi` on desktop + `PlatformPaths` (model/storage per OS) | ⬜ | Path logic shared with S5 |
| D2 | Desktop UX pass (window sizing, menus) + Windows/Linux | ⬜ | |

### Online Platform — "Privoice Cloud" (Convex backend + Next.js web + online tier)
Opt-in, off by default. Stack: **Convex** (auth, DB, functions, file storage) · **Next.js/React** web · **RevenueCat** billing · **OpenRouter** models. Own spec.
| ID | Item | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| O0 | **Flutter ↔ Convex spike** | ⬜ | De-risk mobile↔Convex (HTTP actions + auth token / `convex_flutter`) before committing |
| O1 | Convex backend + shared Auth + Next.js web scaffold w/ login | ⬜ | Accounts shared web + mobile |
| O2 | Subscription + BYOK: RevenueCat + web billing, entitlements in Convex | ⬜ | Sub = our OpenRouter key (metered); BYOK = user key |
| O3 | Online AI proxy (Convex action → OpenRouter) | ⬜ | Entitlement-gated |
| O4 | Web: AI chat with documents (upload → parse → RAG → chat) | ⬜ | Node parsing: pdf-parse/mammoth |
| O5 | Mobile online-tier client (settings toggle, route AI online) | ⬜ | |

**Monorepo goes polyglot:** add `apps/web` (Next.js) + `convex/` (backend) alongside the Flutter app; melos manages Dart, JS uses its own tooling.

## Testing & Quality  → full strategy in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)

World-class quality requires **real-device testing across a tier matrix** (emulators can't measure speed/RAM/thermal/battery for on-device ML). Workstream:

| ID | Item | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| T0 | Test foundation: fakes (repo/AI) + unit + widget tests | ✅ | 28 tests: fakes, Meeting serialization, repository CRUD (ffi in-memory), prompts, map_reduce, Home + Transcript widget tests |
| T1 | Golden tests (light/dark) + **zero-network privacy gate** | 🔨 | **Privacy gate ✅** — `privacy_gate_test.dart` asserts the offline flow creates 0 HTTP clients (Dart layer); OS-level airplane check via device is the complement. Golden tests still ⬜ |
| T2 | CI pipeline (analyze + tests + debug build) on PRs | ✅ | **Green on GitHub Actions**: analyze + test (10m) and Android debug build incl. fllama/sherpa native (15m) both pass. Tests run sequentially to avoid the native-build race |
| T3 | Real-device matrix on Firebase Test Lab | ✅ | **Robo matrix green** on project `privoice-app`: virtual A11 + OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite (A14) + Galaxy S22 (A16), no crashes/ANRs. `tools/run-test-lab.sh` (pick devices with capacity — oriole/redfin queue at 0). Follow-ups: nightly automation + instrumentation-on-FTL + perf capture |
| T4 | STT WER harness + real-meeting corpus (accents, crosstalk, far mic, Arabic) | ⬜ | |
| T5 | LLM minutes quality eval (rubric + LLM-as-judge) per model tier | ⬜ | |
| T6 | Perf/thermal/battery harness → **device-tier→model table** (feeds S5) | ⬜ | |
| T7 | Accessibility + **Arabic / RTL** pass (GCC market) | ⬜ | |
| T8 | Automated release gates + quality dashboard | ⬜ | |

**Current automated coverage:** **28 tests** (`melos run test`) — unit (serialization, repository CRUD via in-memory ffi, prompts, map-reduce, config, benchmark) + **widget tests** (Home: empty/list/search; Transcript: smart-action bar, summarize→minutes, action-item chips) with fakes for repo/AI. Plus one STT integration test + sentinel-gated on-device STT & LLM self-tests. CI workflow written. **Gaps:** golden tests, privacy zero-network gate, device matrix, ML-quality/perf harness, live CI run.

## Known gaps / tech debt

- **Model delivery:** S5 in-app download + R3 first-launch staged/background download now cover model delivery for a real install (onboarding → background download → per-model unlock, resumes on relaunch). **On-device (Redmi) confirmed the deferred risk:** the in-process download stalls when the screen auto-locks (OS suspends the process, drops the socket). **Mitigated:** `ModelManager` now holds a screen wakelock while downloading (best-effort; failures never abort the download), so a one-sitting setup completes — same approach S5 used. **Follow-up (still open): true OS foreground-service downloader** (`background_downloader` + progress notification + `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`) so downloads survive the app being backgrounded / swiped away and the screen turning off; the `ModelManager` interface stays the same. Manual `adb push` (flat `files/` root) remains only a dev/test convenience.
- **Cold-start cost:** first transcription per launch pays ~8 s model load (one-shot `compute` isolate). Optimize later with a warm long-lived isolate.
- **STT accuracy unvalidated on real meetings:** only clean sample tested. Need WER on accents/crosstalk/far-field + sustained RTF on 1-hour audio + thermal.
- **Spike harness retained:** `spike_screen.dart`, `benchmark.dart`, `integration_test/`, `tools/emulator-stt-test.sh` kept for re-benchmarking; not wired into the shipping app.
- **drift vs sqflite:** using sqflite for speed; spec mentioned drift. Swappable behind `MeetingRepository`.

## Environment facts (so nobody re-learns them)

- **Test device:** Redmi 15C — MediaTek Helio G (MT6769), 8 GB, Android 15, arm64-v8a. A good *low-end worst case*.
- **Xiaomi install quirk:** `adb install` fails `INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED` (Install-via-USB needs a SIM). Workaround: `adb push` APK to `/sdcard/Download` and tap-install on the phone.
- **Scoped-storage quirk:** the app reads adb-pushed files only from the **flat** app-owned `files/` root, not adb-created nested subdirs. Real download flow (S5) is unaffected.
- **Model:** `sherpa-onnx-nemo-parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8` (643 MB), from k2-fsa releases tag `asr-models`.
- **Key versions:** sherpa_onnx 1.13.4, record 5.2.1 (+ override `record_platform_interface 1.5.0`, `record_linux 1.3.1`), sqflite 2.4.x.

## Recommended next order
1. **S3** on-device LLM spike → summary/minutes (de-risks LLM + unblocks chat)
2. **S5** in-app model download (self-sufficient app)
3. **S6** chat panel
4. **S4** export → then diarization, then S7 docs, then S8 online tier
